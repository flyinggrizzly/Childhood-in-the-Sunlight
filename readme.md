# Childhood in the Sunlight

*a [Forged in the Dark](https://bladesinthedark.com/licensing) game about
the bittersweet joy of growing up, and adventures with your friends*

## Motivation:

This game aims to answer the question "can I hack together an optimistic, if
possibly bittersweet, hack of _Blades in the Dark_"?

Generally, I've set some principles for myself:

- light hearted adventure, not tragedy or grimdark fantasy
- life or death situations, but the kids don't die
- while growing up is magical, there's a bittersweet quality to maturing

## Approach

Most of this is still in *way* early stages, but I've got some thoughts
already:

- adventures replace the crew
- **Maturities** replace **Traumas**
- characters don't 'trauma' out, they just go on to middleschool at the end of
  the arc where they took their 4th **Maturity**
- **Maturities** might also give a bonus to an action--they are good things
  afterall: **Compassionate** might give +1d to a **Consort** (or whatever might
  replace it) roll
- action ratings become less violent, more child-like...

## Credits and stuff

A lot of the foundational ideas that deviate from _Blades_ have come from
[_Tales from the
Loop_](https://www.modiphius.net/collections/tales-from-the-loop/products/tales-from-the-loop-rpg-rulebook)
by Free League Games. Thanks guys, it's a magical game.
