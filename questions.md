# Questions

Things that come up as I work and should really have a good answer before I can
call this 'done'.

- the long summer of leisure is an experience I was privileged to have as a kid,
  even if not in the same way that the kids did in the touchstones (I *wish* I
  could have had adventures like in _The Goonies_). **How can I make sure that
  this game *shares* that experience with everyone, rather than being exclusively
  for people who have already had that?**
- how does having typical game actions (*Scrap, Scramble, Consort*) focus the
  experience of play? If I want to foreground the magic of shared imagination,
  **do I need to be choosing actions that eschew the real world more?** (as
  always, think *Girl by Moonlight* by Andrew Gillis)
