Scratch sheet for thinking through the action verbs, and attributes to use for the kids.

## Principles

- focus on creating worlds through imagination
- focus on sharing imagined worlds
- defocus physical struggle, except in extremis
- foreground emotional content, a la _The Veil_ by Fraser Simons and _Girl by Moonlight_ by Andrew Gillis

## Attributes and maturity adjective dots

The adjective dot I think says a lot about the Attribute and its function in the game... so let's keep these hand in hand.

Currently working with

- Mind (Reasoned)
- Body (Embodied)
- Heart (Compassionate)

## Action verbs

Let's see if we can't focus the right mix of imagination, sharing, and embodiment of that imagination into an adventure by using the right verbs...

| Mind     | Body     | Heart   |
| ===      |===       |===      |
| Invent   | Scrap    | Express |
| Research | Scramble | Dream   |
| Argue    | Sneak    | Tantrum |
