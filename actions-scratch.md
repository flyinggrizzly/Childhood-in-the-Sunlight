Scratch sheet for thinking through the action verbs, and attributes to use for the kids.

## Principles

- focus on creating worlds through imagination
- focus on sharing imagined worlds
- defocus physical struggle, except in extremis
- foreground emotional content, a la _The Veil_ by Fraser Simons and _Girl by Moonlight_ by Andrew Gillis

## Attributes and maturity adjective dots

The adjective dot I think says a lot about the Attribute and its function in the game... so let's keep these hand in hand.

Currently working with

- Mind (Reasoned)
- Body (Embodied)
- Heart (Compassionate)

I really want to foreground the imagination aspect of things for this... so maybe we could go with

- Creativity (Driven)
- Interconnection (tbd)
- Brains (Reasoned)

this defocuses the body too much. Adventure is still important here. I'm aware that this is dancing kinda close to ableism, but even journeys of the mind, so to speak, use the model of physical travel as a metaphor (a 'journey'). And I think losing the body stuff runs too close to losing the wide open stretches of field and forest that I want people to go scrambling through.
