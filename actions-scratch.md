Scratch sheet for thinking through the action verbs, and attributes to use for the kids.

## Principles

- focus on creating worlds through imagination
- focus on sharing imagined worlds
- defocus physical struggle, except in extremis
- foreground emotional content, a la _The Veil_ by Fraser Simons and _Girl by Moonlight_ by Andrew Gillis

## Attributes and maturity adjective dots

The adjective dot I think says a lot about the Attribute and its function in the game... so let's keep these hand in hand.

Currently working with

- Mind (Reasoned)
- Body (Embodied)
- Heart (Compassionate)

## Action verbs

Let's see if we can't focus the right mix of imagination, sharing, and embodiment of that imagination into an adventure by using the right verbs...

| Mind     | Body     | Heart   |
| ---      |---       |---      |
| Invent   | Scrap    | Express |
| Research | Scramble | Dream   |
| Argue    | Sneak    | Tantrum |


## GbM action verbs

Going to try modifying Andrew's verbs from _Girl by Moonlight_ to see if I can
get somewhere good... they're a little too mature to start with, but I really do
want to get closer to the roll adding context to the action, like in GbM and The
Veil

| Innocent (moe) | Brash (Tsundere) | Cold (Kuudere) |
| ---            | ---              | ---            |
| Confess        | Express          | Conceal        |
| Forgive        | Defy             | Flow           |
| Perceive       | Empathize        | Analyze        |
