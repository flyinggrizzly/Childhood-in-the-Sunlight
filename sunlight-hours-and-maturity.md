TODO:

- what does the **Growing up** track do? is it even necessary?
  - should this be a more mechanical version of 'when your maturity distances
    you from your friends?'

# Sunlight Hours and Maturity

**Sunlight Hours** and **Maturity** replace **Stress** and **Trauma** from core
_Blades_.

When a kid marks a **Maturity**, the permanently fill in one of their **Sunlight
Hours**--they are growing up and have obligations that they must fulfill outside
of their adventures with the gang.

In exchange, however, each new **maturity** allows you to write a new tag into
one of your Attributes. These tags, like in other PbtA (and other) games, are
traits you can call on to give
yourself an edge in a situation. You could, for example, call on your
*"emotional"* **maturity** to grant yourself a bonus die when rolling
[Consort], or [Sway], or even [Skirmish] if you were in a scuffle and
strong emotions were on the line.

You can call on multiple **maturities** in one roll.

Every time you rely on one of your **maturities**, you should also fill in a
spot on your **Growing up** track.
