TODO:

- what does the **Growing up** track do? is it even necessary?
  - should this be a more mechanical version of 'when your maturity distances
    you from your friends?'

# Idle Hours and Maturity

**Idle Hours** and **Maturity** replace **Stress** and **Trauma** from core
_Blades_.

## Idle Hours

Idle Hours work a little differently than Stress, but not massively so.

- a kid starts with 10 Idle Hours
- you can mark all 10 Hours before there are consequences. Those come when you
would mark an 11th hour

You can use them in the usual ways: pushing, assisting, resisting consequences.

**When you would mark a Idle Hour, but don't have a slot on your sheet for
it,**
your kid has been called home for the day. **If you go straight home,** your kid is
out of the action for the rest of the adventure (if it's turning out to be a
very long adventure, talk with your GM about when might be a good time to come
back in before the end). **If you stay out late with your friends,** carry on
marking Hours on the second line of the Hour track. You can keep spending Hours
as usual. If you fill the second Hour track, your caregivers come out to get you
and you must go home immediately (do they call the cops to find you? come get
you themselves? is it embarrassing?)

**When you get home after staying out late,** roll a number of dice equal to the
number of Hours you stayed out late.

- on a crit, you manage to convince your caregivers that it was for a good
reason. You can go back and find your friends today, or clear a **Care**
- on a 6, you mostly convince them things are alright. You are home for the day,
but you're not grounded or anything. If you do it again, you might get grounded
though, so mark a **Care**
- on a 4-5, you're in trouble, and grounded, but it's not the worst. Start the
next adventure with 1 Hour already marked--you'll have to be home early. Mark a
**Care**
- on a 1-3, you're really in trouble now! Definitely grounded. You start the
next Adventure with 3 Hours already marked, and mark a **Care**

## Cares

**Cares** are really just a 6 segment clock. When it fills, you have matured a little. Take a
**Maturity**.

## Maturity

When a kid marks a **Maturity**, the permanently fill in one of their **Idle
Hours**--they are growing up and have obligations that they must fulfill outside
of their adventures with the gang.

In exchange, however, each new **maturity** allows you to write a new tag into
one of your Attributes. These tags, like in other PbtA (and other) games, are
traits you can call on to give
yourself an edge in a situation. You could, for example, call on your
*"emotional"* **maturity** to grant yourself a bonus die when rolling
[Consort], or [Sway], or even [Skirmish] if you were in a scuffle and
strong emotions were on the line.

When resisting a consequence, the **maturity** grants you an extra die to the
roll for an Attribute in which it lives.

You can call on multiple **maturities** in one roll (except Resistance rolls).

Every time you rely on one of your **maturities**, you should also fill in a
spot on your **Growing up** track.
