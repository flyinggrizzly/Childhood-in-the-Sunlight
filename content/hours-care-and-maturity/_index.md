**Hours** and **Maturity** replace **Stress** and **Trauma** from core
_Blades_.

TODO:

- what does the **Growing up** track do? is it even necessary?
  - should this be a more mechanical version of 'when your maturity distances
    you from your friends?'
- enumerate the possible **Maturities**. There will be:
  - 3 that grant an Attribute tag
  - 3 that grant some other benefit (maybe a new special ability?)


There are two kinds of **Hours**: *Idle*, and *Midnight*. They both serve the
same purpose, but you only start marking **Midnight Hours** when you've used all
of your **Idle Hours**, and you *know* you're gonna be in trouble with your
caregiver when you get home.

## Idle Hours

Idle Hours work a little differently than Stress, but not massively so.

- a kid starts with 10 Idle Hours
- you can mark all 10 Hours before there are consequences. Those come when you
would mark an 11th hour

You can use them in the usual ways: pushing, assisting, resisting consequences.

**When you would mark a Idle Hour, but don't have a slot on your sheet for
it,**
your kid has been called home for the day. **If you go straight home,** your kid is
out of the action for the rest of the adventure (if it's turning out to be a
very long adventure, talk with your GM about when might be a good time to come
back in before the end). **If you stay out late with your friends,** carry on
marking Hours on the second line of the Hour track, your **Midnight Hours**. You can keep spending Hours
as usual. If you fill the second Hour track, your caregivers come out to get you
right away
and you must go home immediately (do they call the cops to find you? come get
you themselves? is it embarrassing?)

**When you get home after staying out late,** clear your **Idle Hours** track,
and if you have marked any **Midnight Hours** roll dice equal to the number
of unmarked Midnight Hours left on your sheet:

- on a crit, you manage to convince your caregivers that it was for a good
reason. You can go back and find your friends today, or clear a **Care**
- on a 6, you mostly convince them things are alright. You are home for the day,
but you're not grounded or anything.
- on a 4-5, you're in trouble, and grounded, but it's not the worst.
Mark a **Care**
- on a 1-3, you're really in trouble now! Definitely grounded. You start the
next Adventure with 2 Hours already marked, and mark a **Care**

At the end of an adventure, if you haven't cleared your **Idle Hours** track
from going home, do so.

Leave any marks in your **Midnight Hours** track until you [do a
chore](chores/) to earn
your caregivers' trust again.

## Cares

**Cares** are really just a progress clock. When it fills, you have matured a little. Take a
**Maturity**.

The clock starts as an 4-segment clock. When you've taken your first
**Maturity**, it becomes a 6-segment clock for the next two. Before the last one, it's 8 segments.
And when that's full... that's it. You're not really a kid anymore. You can
finish out your gang's grand adventure, but you probably won't be hanging out
next Summer.

Kids who have marked **Maturities** have fewer **Idle Hours** than their younger
friends, but if they really need to, they can mark a **Care** instead of marking
any **Hours** (of either kind).

## Maturity

When a kid marks a **Maturity**, they permanently fill in one of their **Idle
Hours**--they are growing up and have obligations that they must fulfill outside
of their adventures with the gang.

In exchange, however, each new **maturity** allows you to write a new tag into
one of your Attributes. These tags, like in other PbtA (and other) games, are
traits you can call on to give
yourself an edge in a situation. You could, for example, call on your
*"emotional"* **maturity** to grant yourself a bonus die when rolling
[Consort], or [Sway], or even [Skirmish] if you were in a scuffle and
strong emotions were on the line.

When resisting a consequence, the **maturity** grants you an extra die to the
roll for an Attribute in which it lives.

You can call on multiple **maturities** in one roll (except Resistance rolls).

Every time you rely on one of your **maturities**, you should also fill in a
spot on your **Growing up** track.
