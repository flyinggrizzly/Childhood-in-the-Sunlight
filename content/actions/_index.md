Actions and Attributes define the things your kid is good at... and where
they'll need some help from friends.

| Mind       | Body       | Heart           |

_\* denotes a special adjective gained by taking **maturities**. There is only one dot
for these. They add a die to resistance rolls in their attribute, and can also
grant a bonus die whenever it would make sense for the action being performed._

## Mind

Resist consequences from understanding or people tricking you.

### Invent

When you **invent** something, you use your wits, imagination, and resources, to
*make* something *new*. It might be a modification to your wrist-rocket, or an
elaborate alarm and security system for your secret hideout, or a secret way of
sending messages to your friends, bedroom to bedroom. You might also invent a
new world for your gang to adventure through, though **dream** might be better.

### Research

When you spend time at the library, on the net, or bugging some adult who's an
expert, you **research** something important. You might find out the secret
history of your hometown, that Aliens are secretly hiding just past the train
tracks, or that important piece of info you needed to finish an invention. You
might also do some research by peering through the baddies' windows, though
**sneak** might be better.

### Talk

When you **talk** to someone, you use reason, logic, or maybe appeal to their
weaknesses or prejudices. You might get your parents to let you stay over at a
friend's house for late-night planning, or get your friends to realize that your
plan is *awesome*, or Mrs. Greenblatt that your gang *needs* to cut across her
fields because it's really important. You might also talk to convince someone to help
you make your dreams real, though **share** might be better.

### Reasoned

You are getting a little bit wiser. Maybe you're not so quick to jump to
conclusions, or you have a greater wealth of knowledge after years of reading,
or you are getting good at recognizing patterns. Whatever it is for you, you get
an extra die on **Mind** resistance rolls, and you can add a bonus die to actions
where your cool-headedness is a benefit. This can be for rolls in any attribute,
not just **Mind**.

## Body

Resist consequences from physical activity.

### Scrap

When you **scrap** with someone or something, you use your strength, nimbleness,
and canny to hold your own in a tussle. It might be a showdown in the parking
lot after school, or getting the drop on some *thing*. You might even scrap to
break through that fence over there, though **invent** might be better.

### Scramble

### Sneak

### Embodied

## Heart

Resist consequences from social or emotional strain.

### Share

### Dream

### Tantrum

### Compassionate
