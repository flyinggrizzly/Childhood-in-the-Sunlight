# Actions and Attributes

I am debating between more normal actions and attributes a la Blades, and more
emotional or imaginative ones, closer to those in *Girl by Moonlight*.

## Normal attributes

### Mind:
- action
- action
- action
- fourth action?

### Body:

- action
- action
- action
- fourth action?

### Heart:

- action
- action
- action
- fourth action?

## Attributes that focus imagination and friendship

TODO:

- figure out what these might be
