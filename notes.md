- maybe actions should be different imaginative propensities?
  - landscapes
  - tools
  - creatures
  - disguise
  - ability communicate imagination to friends

what if the stress/sunlight hours track reversed--instead of counting down, you
count it up, and when you pass a certain threshold, you have to start rolling
for getting called home, or take the consequences when you get home but didn't
respond to the call?

^^or is that where entanglements come in?^^
